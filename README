About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The software in this respository generates python bindings to optimization code
generated through the QPgen Matlab library for convex optimizations.

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required software:
	Matlab
	QPgen
	GNU make
	
Install Matlab. Version R2016a is the only verified version. Get QPgen from
http://www.control.lth.se/QPgen/installation.html and follow the installation
instructions. Install make through your preferred package manager.

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look at example.mk, example.m and example.py. Modify them or create a new .mk
where you input a m-file and a library name. Create the m-file which specifies
the system for QPgen. Then execute make as 'make CONFIG=your.mk'. Repeated make
will read from a file (.config) where it stores the CONFIG variable and hence
you do not need to specify CONFIG again unless you want to change config.
